                       <p><h4>++ Hello My name is Antoine Price jr and I enjoy computer 
                         programming, the main reason why I find it fufilling 
                          is becuase it's part of stem, an other reason why I find it gratifying is that  when I was in highschool  in
                          a biology class, I over heard the teacher talked about bill gates and 
                          mark zuckerberge, how bill gates created windows and that mark zukerbage
                          created facebook . I immediately want on a journey to find out how did these genius do what they done.
                          I knew before I start anywhere I needed to know what was a computer program
                          if I wanted to understand how did bill gates and mark zukerbage created software. 
                          I was fearlessly searching google for answers, at 
                          that point I found all of my answers.
                          I learned that compter uses a computer language 
                          called binary also that there are low level computer languages and high level
                           computer programming lanugages. I was thrilled to find out more so I learned c++, python, java and more.
                           I am tenacious about the field of computer science. I was fascinated by the simple
                            fact that I can created anything, I wanted from scratch and all I needed to do was be creative while using logic .
